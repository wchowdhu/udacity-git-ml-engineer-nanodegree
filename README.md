# About

Project work from the Udacity [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree 2020](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) encompassing advanced machine learning algorithms and how to package and deploy models to a production environment. 

  - Content of the coursework is co-created with Kaggle and includes real-world projects covering Machine Learning workflow of data processing and exploration, modeling, to deployment.
  - Gain practical experience using Amazon SageMaker to deploy trained models to a web application and evaluate the performance of the models.
  - A/B test models and learn how to update the models as more data is gathered, an important skill in industry.
