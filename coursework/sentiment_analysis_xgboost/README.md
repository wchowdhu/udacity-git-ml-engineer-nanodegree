# Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost in Amazon SageMaker 

This mini-project uses Amazon's SageMaker service to construct random tree models using the XGBoost package and predict the sentiment of a movie review as positive or negative using the [IMDB Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). The trained machine learning models are then deployed to a production environment using [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker). 

# Install
The exercises require Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed   
  - [numpy](https://numpy.org/)

# Run
To run and execute the .ipynb files, set up a Notebook instance in the Amazon Sagemaker service and link the instance directly to the [Github repository](https://github.com/wchowdhu/udacity-ml-engineer-nanodegree.git).
